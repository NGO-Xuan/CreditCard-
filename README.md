# CreditCard-

## 1. Introduction
We downloaded CreditCard dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata. 
we concentrate on creating different clusters to get more information in order to to develop a customer segmentation from credit data. 
Credit card data are rich in terms of both volume and variety, providing insights into both customer shopping and payment preferences. Billions and Billions of transactions take place each year, creating billions of opportunities to understand customers better. Surprisingly, many banks don't use this wealth of information. Instead, they opt for mass marketing and costly above-the-line communications.

Segment 1(cluster 0): Financially Smart Customers of this segment love to keep their finances in order and dislike having huge debt. They are financially smart and know how to keep credit in check. Issuers can motivate them to use credit card more often for their day to day purchases by offering them occassional rewards. Additionally, issuers can differentiate their cards in such a way that they are easy to use and facilitates financial success. For instance, if a customer makes a large purchase, the credit card should have a feature that divides the amount in low-rate installment loan. This will help overcome customers occassional needs without worrying about debt.

Segment 2(cluster 1): Financially Stressed Customers in this segment carry heavy credit card debt nearly 6 times that of financially smart and 3 times that of average credit card debt, at $4983. They often withdraw high amount of cash and make low minimum payment which results in higher debt. They are unable to control their spending and doubt whether they will get out of burden. The customers in this segment value transparency and simplicity in rates, fees and terms. However, their biggest need is that the issuer allows them to impose their own spending limit so that they can use credit card for large purchases which takes time to repay. However, no bank can entertain this request as they fear customer can default.

In this way, by building a richer, deeper view of customer segments, financial institutions can sharpen their value proposition, increasing the share of wallet and becoming the primary card via identification of high-potential cardholders. They can also selectively upgrade card limits and tiers for maximum return on risk. Additionally, they can retain the most valuable customers by accurately evaluating customer value and attrition risk, guaranteeing long-term satisfaction and loyalty by increasing relevance in communications and offers. This approach helps in rallying business units around a common goal and a single company-wide view of the customer.
